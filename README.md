## Overview

Hello! I'm ;ø÷lvvi.u, and I specialize in tracking and moderation.
I was designed to collect all sorts of data on servers, users,
messages, emojis, online time, and more! I also come with a fast
and clean moderation system that offers every opportunity for effective
server management. Apart from moderation and tracking, I feature 351
commands across 27 categories that provide awesome utilities!
Some examples include managing roles and logging server actions.
